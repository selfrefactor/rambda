---
such types as `SortObjectPredicate` need to be exported
---
in js project like niketa theme, go to source lead to readable code, is ramda the same?

what about ts react
---
add motivation

optimize above the fold
---
include new methods to method to skip list
---
issue with gh release
---
throttle should accept 0 arguments, i.e. no need to force unary function
---
splitWith
R.pickWith
R.pickAllWith - maybe
---
wont do
include standut x methods to rambda

such as

sortObject
---
R.findInObject
---
restore maptoobject x@2.1.0

why mapObject is not same
---
REFS:

- forEachObjIndexed should not contain source file nor test file

fix https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambdax/issues/93

Double check

it('mixed', () => {
    const result = head(mixedList)
    result // $ExpectType string | number
  })
  
  and typing of `R.head` suggest that this issue could be on many more places

> Idea of this file is to store CHANGELOG changes until MR is ready to be opened.

differenceWith

---
apply to allPass
https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/pull/695/files
---
use todos and clear todos when this file is smaller
check again deno as dissocpath doesn't add js extension to imports
---
try omitPath as method instead of multiple paths
---
replace missing ramda methods with text that argument is missing
===
publish after march 2024

export function anyPass<T, U extends T[]>(predicates: { [K in keyof U]: (x: T) => x is U[K]; }): (input: T) => input is U[number];
