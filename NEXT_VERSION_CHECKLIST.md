in js project like niketa theme, go to source lead to readable code, is ramda the same?

fix https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambdax/issues/93

release X

no need to test curried methods such as replace

automate deno release

deno is advantage as Ramda last release is 3 years ago
---
group TS test for similar methods

eventual create additional topic in methods - related methods, so it is easy to find tests as the first one alpabetically is the one containing all TS tests

Double check

it('mixed', () => {
    const result = head(mixedList)
    result // $ExpectType string | number
  })
  
  and typing of `R.head` suggest that this issue could be on many more places

> Idea of this file is to store CHANGELOG changes until MR is ready to be opened.

apply to allPass
https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/pull/695/files
---
use todos and clear todos when this file is smaller
check again deno as dissocpath doesn't add js extension to imports
---
try omitPath as method instead of multiple paths
---
replace missing ramda methods with text that argument is missing
