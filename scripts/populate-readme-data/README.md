## Example use

```javascript
import { compose, map, filter } from 'rambda'

const result = compose(
  map(x => x * 2),
  filter(x => x > 2)
)([1, 2, 3, 4])
// => [6, 8]
```

## Rambda's advantages

- Tree-shaking

Currently **Rambda** is more tree-shakable than **Ramda**

- Speed

**Rambda** is generally more performant than `Ramda` as the [benchmarks](#benchmarks) can prove that.

- dot notation for `R.path` and `R.paths`

Standard usage of `R.path` is `R.path(['a', 'b'], {a: {b: 1} })`.

In **Rambda** you have the choice to use dot notation(which is arguably more readable):

```
R.path('a.b', {a: {b: 1} })
```

- comma notation for `R.pick` and `R.omit`

Similar to dot notation, but the separator is comma(`,`) instead of dot(`.`).

```
R.pick('a,b', {a: 1 , b: 2, c: 3} })

// No space allowed between properties
```

- Typescript included

Typescript definitions are included in the library, in comparison to **Ramda**, where you need to additionally install `@types/ramda`.
