## Differences between Rambda and Ramda

- Rambda's **type** detect async functions and unresolved `Promises`. The returned values are `'Async'` and `'Promise'`.

- Rambda's **type** handle `NaN` input, in which case it returns `"NaN"`.

- Rambda's **path** and **paths** accepts dot notation(`'x.y' same as ['x','y']`)

- Rambda's **pick** and **omit** accept comma notation(`'x,y' same as ['x','y']`)

- Rambda's **map**, **filter**, **reject** and **forEach** can iterate over objects not only arrays.

- Rambda's **map** and **filter** pass array index as second argument when mapping over arrays.

- Rambda's **defaultTo** accept indefinite number of arguments when non curried, i.e. `R.defaultTo(2, foo, bar, baz)`.

- Rambda's **adjust**, **all**, **allPass**, **any**, **anyPass**, **findIndex** , **findLastIndex** and **reject** are passing index as second argument to the predicate function.

- Rambda's **startsWith/endsWith** work only with strings, instead with array and strings.

- Rambda's **equals** doesn't protect against circular structures as **Ramda.equals** does.

- Rambda's **flip** works only for functions expecting two arguments.

- Rambda's **partial** doesn't need the input arguments to be wrapped as array.

- Rambda's **filter** returns empty array with bad input(`null` or `undefined`), while Ramda throws.

- Ramda's **includes** will throw an error if input is neither `string` nor `array`, while **Rambda** version will return `false`.

- Ramda's **clamp** work for letters, while Rambda's method work only for numbers.
