## Differences between Rambda and Ramda

- Rambda's **type** detects async functions and unresolved `Promises`. The returned values are `'Async'` and `'Promise'`.

- Rambda's **type** handles *NaN* input, in which case it returns `NaN`.

- Rambda's **forEach** can iterate over objects not only arrays.

- Rambda's **map**, **filter**, **partition** when they iterate over objects, they pass property and input object as predicate's argument.

- Rambda's **filter** returns empty array with bad input(`null` or `undefined`), while Ramda throws.

- Ramda's **clamp** work with strings, while Rambda's method work only with numbers.

- Error handling, when wrong inputs are provided, may not be the same. This difference will be better documented once all brute force tests are completed.

- Typescript definitions between `rambda` and `@types/ramda` may vary.
