# Rambda

\`Rambda\` is faster and smaller alternative to the popular functional programming library **Ramda**. - [Documentation](https://selfrefactor.github.io/rambda/#/)

## Example use

\`\`\`javascript
import { compose, map, filter } from 'rambda'

const result = compose(
  map(x => x * 2),
  filter(x => x > 2)
)([1, 2, 3, 4])
// => [6, 8]
\`\`\`

You can test this example in <a href=\\"https://rambda.now.sh?const%20result%20%3D%20R.compose(%0A%20%20R.map(x%20%3D%3E%20x%20*%202)%2C%0A%20%20R.filter(x%20%3D%3E%20x%20%3E%202)%0A)(%5B1%2C%202%2C%203%2C%204%5D)%0A%0A%2F%2F%20%3D%3E%20%5B6%2C%208%5D\\">Rambda's REPL</a>

## Rambda's advantages

- Tree-shaking

Currently **Rambda** is more tree-shakable than **Ramda**

- Speed

**Rambda** is generally more performant than \`Ramda\` as the [benchmarks](#benchmarks) can prove that.

- dot notation for \`R.path\` and \`R.paths\`

Standard usage of \`R.path\` is \`R.path(['a', 'b'], {a: {b: 1} })\`.

In **Rambda** you have the choice to use dot notation(which is arguably more readable):

\`\`\`
R.path('a.b', {a: {b: 1} })
\`\`\`

- comma notation for \`R.pick\` and \`R.omit\`

Similar to dot notation, but the separator is comma(\`,\`) instead of dot(\`.\`).

\`\`\`
R.pick('a,b', {a: 1 , b: 2, c: 3} })

// No space allowed between properties
\`\`\`

- Typescript included

Typescript definitions are included in the library, in comparison to **Ramda**, where you need to additionally install \`@types/ramda\`.


- More generic methods

\`Ramda\` has an overwhelming list of methods, as one could get lost putting all these methods in one's head. \`Rambda\` has smaller method counts and that could be seen as advantage.

## Install

- **yarn add rambda**

- For UMD usage either use \`./dist/rambda.umd.js\` or following CDN link:

\`\`\`
https://unpkg.com/rambda@CURRENT_VERSION/dist/rambda.umd.js
\`\`\`

## Differences between Rambda and Ramda

- Rambda's **type** detect async functions and unresolved \`Promises\`. The returned values are \`'Async'\` and \`'Promise'\`.

- Rambda's **type** handle \`NaN\` input, in which case it returns \`\\"NaN\\"\`.

- Rambda's **path** and **paths** accepts dot notation(\`'x.y' same as ['x','y']\`)

- Rambda's **pick** and **omit** accept comma notation(\`'x,y' same as ['x','y']\`)

- Rambda's **map**, **reject** and **forEach** can iterate over objects not only arrays.

- Rambda's **map** and **filter** pass array index as second argument when mapping over arrays.

- Rambda's **defaultTo** accept indefinite number of arguments when non curried, i.e. \`R.defaultTo(2, foo, bar, baz)\`.

- Rambda's **adjust**, **all**, **allPass**, **any**, **anyPass**, **findIndex** , **findLastIndex** and **reject** are passing index as second argument to the predicate function.

- Rambda's **startsWith/endsWith** work only with strings, instead with array and strings.

- Rambda's **equals** doesn't protect against circular structures as **Ramda.equals** does.

- Rambda's **flip** works only for functions expecting two arguments.

- Rambda's **partial** doesn't need the input arguments to be wrapped as array.

- Rambda's **filter** returns empty array with bad input(\`null\` or \`undefined\`), while Ramda throws.

- Ramda's **includes** will throw an error if input is neither \`string\` nor \`array\`, while **Rambda** version will return \`false\`.

- Ramda's **clamp** work for letters, while Rambda's method work only for numbers.

> If you need more **Ramda** methods in **Rambda**, you may either submit a \`PR\` or check the extended version of **Rambda** - [Rambdax](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambdax). In case of the former, you may want to consult with [Rambda contribution guidelines.](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Benchmarks

<details>

<summary>
Click to expand all benchmark results

There are methods which are benchmarked only with \`Ramda\` and \`Rambda\`(i.e. no \`Lodash\`).

Note that some of these methods, are called with and without curring. This is done in order to give more detailed performance feedback.
