Suggested new methods for Rambda library:


15. `sortByMultiple` - Sort by multiple criteria:
```typescript
export function sortByMultiple<T>(
  criteria: Array<(a: T, b: T) => number>
): (list: T[]) => T[];
```

These suggestions are based on:
1. Common use cases in TypeScript projects
2. Working well within `R.pipe` chains
3. Having clear, single-purpose functionality
4. Being type-safe
5. Following the library's focus on object manipulation and array operations
6. Complementing existing methods

The suggestions avoid methods that:
1. Have confusing or ambiguous behavior
2. Don't work well in pipe chains
3. Have multiple ways to be used
4. Are better suited as part of application code
5. Have complex TypeScript definitions that would be hard to maintain
