- 2.10.2 Close [issue #175](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/issues/175) - missing typescript file

- 2.10.0 Approve huge and important [PR #171](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/pull/171) submitted by [@helmuthdu](https://github.com/helmuthdu) - Add comments to each method, improve Typescript support

- 2.9.0 `R.toPairs` and `R.fromPairs`

- 2.8.0 Approve [PR #165](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/pull/165) `R.clone`

- 2.7.1 expose `src` | Discussed at [issue #147](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/issues/147)

- 2.7.0 Approve [PR #161](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/pull/161) `R.isEmpty`

- 2.5.0 Close [issue #149](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/issues/149) Add `R.partial` | `R.type` handles `NaN`

- 2.4.0 Major bump of `Rollup`; Stop building for ES5

- 2.3.1 Close [issue #90](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/issues/90) | Add string type of path in `R.pathOr`

- 2.3.0 Close [issue #89](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/issues/89) | Fix missing `Number` TS definition in `R.type`

- 2.2.0 `R.defaultTo` accepts indefinite number of input arguments. So the following is valid expression: `const x = defaultTo('foo',null, null, 'bar')`

- 2.1.0 Restore `R.zip` using [WatermelonDB](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/) implementation.

- 2.0.0 Major version caused by removing of `R.zip` and `R.addIndex`. [Issue #85](https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/issues/85) rightfully finds that the implementation of `R.addIndex` is not correct. This led to removing this method and also of `R.zip` as it had depended on it. The second change is that `R.map`, `R.filter` are passing array index as second argument when looping over arrays. The third change is that `R.includes` will return `false` if input is neigher `string` nor `array`. The previous behaviour was to throw an error. The last change is to increase the number of methods that are passing index as second argument to the predicate function.
