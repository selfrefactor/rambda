ABOVE IS DONE
===
npm version premajor --preid alpha
npm version prerelease --preid beta

    npm version premajor changes 23.1.6 to 24.0.0-0

From that point on, you can increase the prerelease version number using the command npm version prerelease.

    npm version prerelease changes 24.0.0-alpha.0 to 24.0.0-alpha.1
    npm version prerelease changes 23.2.0-alpha.0 to 23.2.0-alpha.1

Then, when youâ€™re ready for the actual release, you use the regular npm version command:

    npm version major changes 24.0.0-alpha.1 to 24.0.0
