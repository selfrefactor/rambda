---
such types as `SortObjectPredicate` need to be exported
---
in js project like niketa theme, go to source lead to readable code, is ramda the same?

what about ts react
---
add motivation

optimize above the fold
---
include new methods to method to skip list
---
issue with gh release
---
throttle should accept 0 arguments, i.e. no need to force unary function
---
splitWith
R.pickWith
R.pickAllWith - maybe
---
wont do
include standut x methods to rambda

such as

sortObject
---
R.findInObject
---
restore maptoobject x@2.1.0

why mapObject is not same
---
REFS:

- forEachObjIndexed should not contain source file nor test file

fix https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambdax/issues/93

---
group TS test for similar methods

---
- construct - it is class helper and classes are not very functional oriented
- constructN
- into - no support for transducer as it is overly complex to implement, understand and read.
- invert - overly complicated and limited use case
- invertObj
- invoker
- keysIn - we shouldn't encourage extending object with `.prototype` 
- lift
- liftN
- mapAccum - `Ramda` example doesn't looks convincing
- mapAccumRight
- memoizeWith - hard to imagine its usage in context of `R.pipe`/`R.compose`
- mergeDeepWith - limited use case
- mergeDeepWithKey
- mergeWithKey
- nAry - hard to argument about and hard to create meaningful TypeScript definitions
- nthArg - limited use case
- o - enough TypeScript issues with `R.pipe`/`R.compose` to add more composition methods
- otherwise - naming is confusing
- pair - `left-pad` types of debacles happens partially because of such methods that should not be hidden, bur rather part of your code base even if they need to exist.
- partialRight - I dislike `R.partial`, so I don't want to add more methods that are based on it
- pipeWith
- project - naming is confusing, but also limited use case
- promap
- reduceRight - I find `right/left` methods confusing so I added them only where it makes sense.
- reduceWhile - functions with 4 inputs - I think that even 3 is too much
- reduced
- remove - nice name but it is too generic. Also, `Rambdax` has such method and there it works very differently
- scan - hard to explain
- sequence
- splitWhenever
- symmetricDifferenceWith
- andThen
- toPairsIn
- transduce
- traverse
- unary
- uncurryN
- unfold - similar to `R.scan` and I find that it doesn't help with readability
- unionWith - why it has its usage, I want to limit number of methods that accept more than 2 arguments
- until
- useWith - hard to explain
- valuesIn
- xprod - limited use case
- thunkify
---
Double check

it('mixed', () => {
    const result = head(mixedList)
    result // $ExpectType string | number
  })
  
  and typing of `R.head` suggest that this issue could be on many more places
---
> Idea of this file is to store CHANGELOG changes until MR is ready to be opened.

differenceWith

---
apply to allPass
https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/pull/695/files
---
use todos and clear todos when this file is smaller
check again deno as dissocpath doesn't add js extension to imports
---
try omitPath as method instead of multiple paths
---
replace missing ramda methods with text that argument is missing
