fix pluck and others where Record is used wrong
// import { pipe, pluck, prop } from "ramda"
import { pipe, pluck, prop } from "rambdax"

export const parseDatabase = pipe( pluck('doc'), pluck('dePart') )

but this works 
export const parseDatabase: (input: DbOrigin[]) => string[] = pipe( pluck('doc'), pluck('dePart') )

Hi I know this is a closed issue right now, but just to let you know for a possible solution that also includes the "exports" statement:

According to the documentation:

    Within the "exports" object, key order is significant. During condition matching, earlier entries have higher priority and take precedence over later entries. The general rule is that conditions should be from most specific to least specific in object order.

So, if you want webpack to pick up a different export than node you should, add a "webpack" condition as the first item the exports map.

Double check

it('mixed', () => {
    const result = head(mixedList)
    result // $ExpectType string | number
  })
  
  and typing of `R.head` suggest that this issue could be on many more places

apply to allPass
https://github.com/selfrefactor/rambda/pull/695/files


- Revert changes in `R.anyPass` introduced in `8.4.0` release. The reason is that the change was breaking the library older than `5.2.0` TypeScript.

in other words, this should be done once there is significant amount of users on `5.2.0` and above
