    ✓ takes only the first `n` elements from a list
    ✓ returns only as many as the array can provide
    ✓ returns an equivalent list if `n` is < 0
    ✓ never returns the input array
    ✓ can operate on strings
    1) handles zero correctly (#1224)
    2) steps correct number of times
    3) transducer called for every member of list if `n` is < 0
